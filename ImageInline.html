<p><br>Welcome to my favorite Dog Image <br/></p>
<p>My German Shepard "Bo" is two years old. He lives with us on the ranch. He likes to spend his days at the barn with the horses and his nights watching TV.</p>

<p> Bo lives with other dogs. His favorite times of the day are breakfast and lunch </p>
